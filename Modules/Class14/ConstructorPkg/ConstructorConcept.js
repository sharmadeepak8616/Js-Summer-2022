/**
 * Constructor
 * 
 *      1. It's a special function.
 *          in JS: name of the constructor is always "constructor"
 *          in Java: name of the constructor is same as of the Class-name
 *      2. In order to create an object of the class, js has to execute the constructor function.
 *          when there is NO constructor in a class
 *              js creates a default constructor, then execute it in order to create the object
 *          If there is any user-defined constructor in a class, js will NEVER create default constructor; 
 *              AND use the user-defined constructor in order to create the object.
 *      3. In JS: we cannot have two constructors in a class
 *

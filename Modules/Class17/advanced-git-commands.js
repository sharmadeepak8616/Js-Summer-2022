 * Invite lab instructors as collaborator
 * Clone the repo in local
 * 
 * 
 * Open terminal
 * Make sure that you are on master or main branch
 * Perform "git pull" to pull code from remote-master to local-master
 * Create new branch (using git branch newBranchName)
 * Checkout on the new branch (using git checkout newBranchName)
 * Push newBranch into remote (using git push -u origin newBranchName)
 * Start working.....
 * 
 * Once done:
 * Push all relevant code files in git (using git add/commit/push)
 * Create a merge request and assign lab instructor as review
